## Hi, I'm @malevitzch

----
## About Me:
I am a computer science student with interests in theoretical informatics and programming language realization (plus some algorithmics).
My favourite programming language is C++, but I also sometimes use Java and Python and, to a lesser extent, Rust. I am also interested in functional programming although I am yet able to write any reasonable code in Haskell or OCaml.
