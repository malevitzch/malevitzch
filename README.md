## Hi, I'm @malevitzch
I am a computer science student with interests in theoretical informatics and programming language realization (plus some algorithmics).
I like writing low-level code and favourite programming language is C++, but I also sometimes use Java and Python and, to a lesser extent, Rust. I am also interested in functional programming and know the basics of OCaml and Haskell.

## Projects
- [froglang](https://github.com/malevitzch/froglang) - A toy programming language which was written using Flex/Bison for parsing and LLVM for code generation. Unfortunately, it doesn't have any practical use but it's a cool project nevertheless (it comes with a compiler CLI similar to compilers such as gcc).
  - Stack: C++, Yacc, Lex, CMake
- [spaceships](https://github.com/malevitzch/spaceships) - My attempt at making a game about spaceships, inspired by Event Horizon and Reassembly.
  - Stack: C++, CMake
- [configs](https://github.com/malevitzch/configs) - A collections of configs for apps that are use for writing code. It also includes a simple bash "package loader" which allows for quickly adding new things to bashrc by creating small files separated into modules.
  - Stack: Bash, Lua, Vimscript
- [chat-app-nodejs](https://github.com/malevitzch/chat-app-nodejs) - A simple chat website which offers websocket-based real-time communication and can be quickly deployed on any machine by using Docker.
  - Stack: Docker, Node.js, HTML, CSS, Sqlite3
- [lambda-calculus-ocaml](https://github.com/malevitzch/lambda-calculus-ocaml) - My experiments with implementing untyped lambda calculus in the OCaml programming languages.
  - Stack: OCaml
- [codeforces](https://github.com/malevitzch/codeforces) - A repository of my solutions to codeforces problems. It also contains a few cool things such as a script that organizes the solutions into directories based on the contest they are from, a script that creates ready-to-use directories for writing contests, and a small collection of templates and libraries to be able to copy-paste commonly used code so I don't have to write it again.
